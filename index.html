                    <p>The Naruto anime, directed by Hayato Date and produced by Studio Pierrot and TV Tokyo, premiered in Japan on October 3, 2002, and concluded on February 8, 2007 after 220 episodes on TV Tokyo. The first 135 episodes were adapted from Part I of the manga; the remaining 85 episodes are original and use plot elements that are not in the manga.Tetsuya Nishio was the character designer for Naruto when the manga was adapted into an anime series; Kishimoto had requested that Nishio be given this role. Beginning on April 29, 2009, the original Naruto anime began a rerun on Wednesdays and Thursdays (until the fourth week of September 2009 when it changed to only Wednesdays). It was remastered in HD, with new 2D and 3D effects, under the name Naruto: Shōnen Hen (少年篇, "Youth Version"). Episodes from the series have been released on both VHS and DVD, and collected as boxed sets.</p>

                    <p>More than two years have passed since the most recent adventures in the Hidden Leaf Village, ample time for ninja wannabe Naruto Uzumaki to have developed skills worthy of recognition and respect. The hyperactive youngster has trained extensively with Jiraiya-sama and returned to Konoha to reunite with friends and, perhaps, partake in more pranks than schoolwork. But Naruto is more determined than ever to become the greatest ninja, and his hard-earned improvements are put to the ultimate test against newer, stronger enemies. "Naruto: Shippuden" is adapted from Part II of the "Naruto" comic book series by Masashi Kishimoto.</p>

            <h4>Naruto the Movie: Ninja Clash in the Land of Snow</em></h4>
            <p>Naruto the Movie: Ninja Clash in the Land of Snow (劇場版 NARUTOナルト 大活劇! 雪姫忍法帖だってばよ!!, Gekijō-ban Naruto: Daikatsugeki! Yukihime Ninpōchō Dattebayo!!, lit. "Theatrical Feature Naruto: Great Action Scene! Snow Princess' Book of Ninja Arts") is a 2004 Japanese animated film based on Masashi Kishimoto's manga and anime series. It was released in Japan on August 21, 2004. The popularity of the series has spawned several sequels, beginning with Naruto the Movie: Legend of the Stone of Gelel. The film is set after episode 101. In the United States, the film aired on Cartoon Network on September 17, 2007. The ending song Home Sweet Home is performed by Yuki. The English adaptation replaced the song with Jeremy Sweet's "Never Give Up", due to licensing restrictions.</p>
            <p>Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno watch a film starring Yukie Fujikaze, in a local cinema. Kakashi Hatake has summoned them to watch it as preparation for their next mission: to prevent Yukie, who plays Princess Gale in the films, from being captured during production of her latest film. Yukie is later revealed to be Koyuki Kazahana, a princess from an island known as the Land of Snow. Doto Kazahana, who is revealed to be Koyuki's uncle, was responsible for the murder of her father Sosetsu in a coup d'etat. During the shooting of the film, Doto's henchmen, wearing chakra armor, attempt to capture the princess, but Team 7 manages to delay the princess from being captured. Doto eventually captures Koyuki and kills her bodyguards, who reveal themselves in an attempt to protect and restore her rightful place as the ruler of the Land of Snow. Naruto enters the ship to rescue the princess, only to be captured and forced to wear a chakra-draining device. Doto forces Koyuki to hand over a crystal necklace her father had given her when she was young, thinking that this is a key that can unlock the hidden treasure Sosetsu had left behind before detaining both Koyuki and Naruto.</p>

            <p>Naruto the Movie: Legend of the Stone of Gelel (劇場版 NARUTOナルト 大激突!幻の地底遺跡だってばよ, Gekijō-ban Naruto: Daigekitotsu! Maboroshi no Chiteiiseki Dattebayo, lit. "Theatrical Feature Naruto: Great Clash! The Illusionary Ruins at the Depths of the Earth") is a 2005 Japanese animated film based on Masashi Kishimoto's manga and anime franchise, written by Hirotsugu Kawasaki and Yuka Miyata.

It aired on Cartoon Network on July 26, 2008 and was released to DVD on July 29, 2008. The film is set after episode 147. The theme song "Ding! Dong! Dang!" is performed by TUBE.</p>
            <p>At a desolated beach, a night-time battle rages between the sand ninjas and bulky, robot-like, armored warriors. Gaara and the group of sand ninjas gain the upper-hand and when the remaining warriors begin to retreat back into the ocean, they shoot flares into the night to reveal a large warship waiting just offshore.

              Meanwhile, Naruto Uzumaki, Shikamaru Nara and Sakura Haruno are on a mission to recover a lost pet ferret when they too are attacked by the armored warriors as well as a mysterious knight named Temujin. After a short battle, both Temujin and Naruto are blasted off a nearby cliff. Shikamaru and Sakura run to the edge to see if they can spot their friend, when suddenly a massive machine, like a giant moving cathedral, plows through the forest and comes to rest not far away.
              
              Naruto and Temujin wake up to find themselves in a moving caravan led by Kahiko and Emina. Luckily the ferret, Nerugui, has survived the fall and has taken a liking to Temujin much to the chagrin of Kahiko whom Naruto discovers is the person whom ordered the mission. Shikamaru investigates the cathedral and discovers a room filled with pods containing human beings. He witnesses two people, Kamina and Ranke associates to Temujin, appear to activate the pods which seem to use the humans to place souls on each armored, soldier body.</p>

            <h4>Naruto Shippuden the Movie</em></h4>
            <p>The opening scene of the movie shows Naruto fighting a monster, only to be killed by it. The setting then goes back to a few days previous, where a man named Yomi attacks a shrine, to retrieve the spirit of Mōryō, a demon who attempted to destroy the world & create his "Thousand Year Kingdom". Since he was lacking a body, Yomi offered his as a temporary substitute, until they could retrieve Mōryō's original one sealed in a different shrine.
              The only threat to Mōryō's plan was a priestess known as Shion, who could seal his spirit away once more. He raises a stone army from their slumber, to attack the rest of the world, while his 4 subordinates go to murder Shion. They're given special chakra creatures to enhance their strength.</p>
            <p>To deal with the threat, Konohagakure sends out many teams to stall the stone army. Naruto Uzumaki, Sakura Haruno, Neji Hyūga & Rock Lee are sent to guard Shion & deliver her to the shrine where Mōryō's body was sealed. They fend off her 4 would-be assassins, who exhaust themselves in a failed attempt to kill Naruto. Shion tells Naruto of his upcoming death; while initially sceptical, her assistant, Taruho, explains that Shion can see the future, & all of the events happening in her visions are 100% true. As they head for the shrine, the group are ambushed once again by Yomi's 4 subordinates & split into 2 teams. Lee kills his opponent by eating an alcoholic candy to get him into Drunken Fist Mode, while Naruto is kept busy by his. Neji tells Sakura to escape with Shion, unaware that his 2 opponents are actually just 1 man & a puppet, to distract him & let the remaining ninja catch up to Sakura & Shion, Sakura is then shot with an anaesthetic Jutsu by the remaining ninja, & Shion is seemingly killed.This turns out to be a ruse: the dead "Shion" was actually Taruho, who transformed himself into a copy of Shion to trick them into thinking that they had killed the real one. Shion then explains that her power works by allowing her spirit to jump back in time at the moment of her death, thereby allowing her to avoid it by having someone else die in her place. Naruto insists that he won't die & likewise would keep Shion safe.</p>

            <h4>Road to Ninja: Naruto the Movie</em></h4>
            <p>Road to Ninja: Naruto the Movie (ロード・トゥ・ニンジャ ‐ナルト・ザ・ムービー‐, Rōdo tu Ninja: Naruto za Mūbī) is the ninth overall Naruto film and sixth Naruto: Shippūden film which was released on July 28, 2012 in Japanese theatres.

The film premiered in more than 45 cities throughout the United States on August 29th, 2014.</p>
            <p>Naruto and the leaf ninja drive off a group of White Zetsu posing as fallen Akatsuki members, Naruto feeling lonely over seeing his friends' impressed families while finding Sakura Haruno arguing with her parents. When Sakura later uses Naruto as an excuse to avoid her parents after he got into an argument with Iruka Umino, the two are confronted by Tobi who subjects them to a limited version of the Infinite Tsukuyomi: The Limited Tsukuyomi (限定月読, Gentei Tsukuyomi). Naruto and Sakura end up in a genjutsu-based reality filled with polar opposites of their friends which reflect their desires: namely a version of Sasuke Uchiha who remained in the village and Naruto's parents are alive while Sakura's have been dead for years. Naruto and Sakura also learn of a masked ninja attacking jinchuriki who is after the Red Moon Scroll which Jiraiya sacrificed his life in sending to Tsunade for safe keeping.

              While Naruto was more focused on returning to their reality before deciding to take in having a family, Sakura enjoyed being an orphan until the loneliness starts getting to her along with the antics of the reality's Sasuke. The village is then attacked by the masked ninja, revealed to have allied himself with Tobi, who has used an incorporeal form to enter the genjutsu reality, as he abducts Sakura to hold ransom for the Red Moon Scroll. Realizing the genjutsu parents, though highly similar, are not like his own, Naruto takes the Red Moon Scroll while running to save Sakura and face the masked ninja.Naruto is overpowered by the masked ninja and his Nine Masked Beasts, when he is saved by the Genjutsu version of Itachi and Akatsuki. While the Akatsuki dispatch the Masked Beasts, Naruto battles against the masked ninja who is revealed to be his Genjutsu world counterpart: Menma (メンマ). Menma absorbs the defeated masked beasts to manifest the Black Nine-Tails, with the Nine-Tails making a temporary truce with Naruto to defeat its counterpart. </p>

            <h4>Watch Naruto: The Last Movie</em></h4>
            <p>The Last: Naruto the Movie is a 2014 Japanese action/romantic animated film produced by Studio Pierrot and directed by Tsuneo Kobayashi. It is based on Masashi Kishimoto's manga and anime Naruto, and is the first film to be a part of the canonical Naruto storyline. It stars Junko Takeuchi, Nana Mizuki, Chie Nakamura, Showtaro Morikubo, Satoshi Hino, Kazuhiko Inoue and Noriaki Sugiyama. Set before the finale of Naruto, the film focuses on Naruto Uzumaki's ninja team as they go on a mission to stop the moon from falling, and rescue Hanabi Hyuga — Hinata Hyuga's sister — from Toneri Otsutsuki, a man who wishes to marry Hinata and punish mankind for weaponising chakra. Naruto and Hinata develop a romantic relationship during their adventure.</p>
            <p>Two years since the peace established in the aftermath of the Fourth Ninja World War, the Sixth Hokage Kakashi Hatake notices that the moon is nearing Earth and will soon collide with it. The crisis is caused by Toneri Otsutsuki, a descendant of the Sage of Six Paths' twin brother Hamura Otsutsuki, who is determined to fulfill Hamura's promise to judge humanity for their millennium-long perversion of the Sage's teachings into ninjutsu. During the Rinne Festival, Hinata Hyuga knits a red scarf similar to the one Naruto wore when they first met with Sakura Haruno offering her assistance. Hinata becomes doubtful as Naruto receives a variety of gifts from others, including another scarf. Toneri infiltrates the Hidden Leaf to abduct Hinata, but Naruto's intervention forces him to instead kidnap her younger sister Hanabi.

              Naruto, Hinata, Sakura, Sai and Shikamaru Nara are assigned by Kakashi to rescue Hanabi. In an abandoned village of the Otsutsuki Clan, Naruto understands the concept of romantic love from seeing Hinata's memories while being caught in an illusion and spending more time with her. The Hyuga Clan revealed to be descended from Hamura's kin who remained on Earth, Toneri had transplanted Hanabi's eyes into himself so he can acquire the Tenseigan (転生眼, lit. "Reincarnation Eye") created from his ancestors' sealed eyes while proposing to Hinata. Hinata accepts the offer to save Hanabi, breaking Naruto's heart in the process as she leaves with Toneri. The villagers on Earth defend themselves, intercepting the moon's meteorites and evacuating civilians while Sasuke Uchiha returns to aid in protecting his home.</p>

            <h4>Boruto: Naruto the Movie</em></h4>
            <p>Boruto: Naruto the Movie is a 2015 Japanese animated film and the directorial debut of Hiroyuki Yamashita. It is based on Masashi Kishimoto's manga and anime Naruto, and is the second film to be a part of the canonical Naruto storyline, being a sequel to the manga series. It stars Yūko Sanpei, Junko Takeuchi, Kokoro Kikuchi and Noriaki Sugiyama. Set after the finale of Naruto, the film focuses on the title character Boruto Uzumaki, son of Naruto's protagonist, Naruto Uzumaki, who cannot stay with his family due to being the leader of his ninja village. Vigilante Sasuke Uchiha returns to the village with warnings about two beings who might become a big threat to the world peace the ninjas managed to bring about in the original series.</p>
            <p>The film opens with a battle between ninja Sasuke Uchiha and an unknown adversary being watched by another enemy. The plot then moves to the protagonist from the Naruto series, Naruto Uzumaki, who has become "the Seventh Hokage", the leader of the village of Konohagakure. He is married to Hinata Uzumaki and has two children, Boruto Uzumaki and Himawari Uzumaki. Boruto, Sarada Uchiha (Sasuke and Sakura Uchiha's daughter), and a child named Mitsuki (Orochimaru's son) become an elite ninja team under their teacher, Konohamaru Sarutobi. Boruto is upset at Naruto for focusing more on being Hokage than on their family.

              Sasuke returns to the village to warn Naruto about the powerful opponent he faced earlier. After Naruto misses Himawari's birthday, Boruto meets Sasuke and asks him to train him so that he can become strong enough to surpass Naruto. Sasuke agrees on the condition that Boruto performs the Rasengan technique, which he then learns from Konohamaru. Sasuke then honors his promise and helps Boruto prepare for the upcoming Chunin Exam, a test taken by young ninjas. Boruto, hoping to convince Naruto to spend more time with him, is tempted to cheat on the exam by using a prototype device, Kote, that stores each type of jutsu. It was given to him by the arrogant scientist Katasuke, who wanted his experiment to gain publicity for marketing purposes before Naruto shot down the proposal. In the exams, Naruto catches Boruto cheating and disqualifies his son. Before Naruto leaves the arena, the two figures Sasuke previously encountered, Kinshiki Otsutsuki and Momoshiki Otsutsuki, appear and destroy it.</p>
